SkyCMS
======

A lightweight, simple and development-oriented CMS.

Why another CMS ? 
-----------------
Well, I don't like to use at a software that I'm not able to master at 100%. I don't want a CMS with 80% super feature that I won't never use (ZendForm is an exemple). 
I wanted a very light stuff, but with as many modules as my client will requested. 
The purpose is to remove all my client's Joomla! site for this one.

Technical information
---------------------

Core in PHP.
Javascript, html, css for all HCI.

I want to make a cms without any use of framework to keep it very weight.


Information
-----------

I do not attend that anyone really download this. But in case of it happens, be aware that I offer absolutely
no warranty with this software. 
You still can contact me @obusco for any questions/help about it.

Installation
------------

1. git clone the repo
2. update database information (/conf/db.xml - I'm way to lazy to keep it up date so, until a V1, I will just provide some dump from my BDD... Yeah I know...)
3. Have Fun !
