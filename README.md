SkyCMS
======

A lightweight, simple and development-oriented CMS.

Why another CMS ? 
-----------------
Well, I don't like to use at a software that I'm not able to master at 100%. I don't want a CMS with 80% super feature that I won't never use (ZendForm is an exemple). 
I wanted a very light stuff, but with as many modules as my client will requested. 
The purpose is to remove all my client's Joomla! site for this one.

Technical information
---------------------

Core in PHP.
Javascript, html, css for all HCI.

I want to make a cms without any use of framework to keep it very weight.


Information
-----------

I do not attend that anyone really download this. But in case of it happens, be aware that I offer absolutely
no warranty with this software. 
You still can contact me @obusco for any questions/help about it.

Main Features
-------------

* Core :
 * Dynamic site(mysql) structure with url rewriting
 * Allow external modules (Two option : Inside the "content div" or with a total external templating as SK_Administrator
 * Allow multi-templating.
* Modules :
 * SK_Administrator : thought as a module (if you prefer design your own, you can go for it), allow all administration attended for administrating.
 * ~~SK_Contact : Do not work, it was a simple try for front-end module.~~
* Themes :
 * No really, there are none of them, just some piece of crap done quickly :3 Even the back-end theme is more beautiful...

Nota : For now, you will have to do a public modules and a private modules. Exemple SK_Contact for front-end and SK_Contact_Admin for back-end (of the modules).


Installation
------------

1. git clone the repo
2. update database information (/conf/db.xml - I'm way to lazy to keep it up date so, until a V1, I will just provide some dump from my BDD... Yeah I know...)
3. Have Fun !
